# Hammad-Portfolio
Hey, and welcome to my portfolio! I am a Computer Science student at GATech with an ongoing concentration in Cybersecurity with a keen interest in the performance and security aspect of today's ever changing digital landscape. I've been polishing my abilities in triaging, malware analysis, SOC simulations and threat hunting, devsecops, compliance implementation and other sub-disciplines that can be broadly labeled at blue-teamed. I have been and continue to build a variety of projects to demonstrate sufficient and expertise in the aforementioned niches of Cybersecurity. 

I am looking for a role that can be losely categorized within the spectrum of a security/SOC analyst, threat hunting, security engineering, etc. My abilitiy to pursue a prestigious degree while working full-time along with building independant and unpaid project and community service should speak to the fact that I am hard-working, committed and willing to put in the work beyond what it's worth!
